# 15 Puzzle Problem

This project implements the classic **15 Puzzle Problem** using Python.  
The 15 Puzzle (also known as the Sliding Puzzle) consists of a 4x4 grid containing numbered tiles and one empty space.  
The goal is to arrange the tiles in order by sliding them into the empty space.

## Features

- Implementation of search algorithms to solve the 15 puzzle.
- Performance comparison of different algorithms.
- Experiment data and runtime comparison graph included.
